# News-Headline-Prediction
Living in such fast-paced life, people need a one stop solution to understand what is happening
around the word with just a single glance. Providing users with a cluster of words based on news
articles and generating headlines based on user's input and previous interest becomes useful.

In this project topics are generated from a given corpus which forms a first look to the user
providing cluster of words that is present in the text. Topic Modelling is an unsupervised technique
to classify documents based on the topics generated from the models. Topics are generated from
the documents through a word wise analysis and its distribution across different documents learnt
from the corpus.

Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) and Markov chain
model will be used to generate topics from the corpus. Following this, Long Short Term Memory
networks (LSTM) is used to generate meaningful headlines depending on the input from the user.
As a long term goal this can be extended to develop a fully autonomous system to generate
topics based on any given corpus and eventually generate meaningful sentences based on user's
input and previously selected topics.
